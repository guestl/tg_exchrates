My attempt to develop telegram bot with python

I am trying to create a bot which will download exchange rates from a set of sites and publish them for users. It is my first big project in python and telegram bot development. 
First part of the project is a family of "loader" classes. They download rates data, parse it and write it into a SQLite database.
Second part is a bot engine.
